- Gave me permission to use a few of his "variated 1.17 ores" from his pack back when I made my first "Randomize It" pack, which are about 3-4 new ore variants for each ore, rest are made by yours truly.

DartCat25 (PMC username) 
- Gave me permission to use his "Menus - Enchanted" pack with some minor texture edits in Reimagined, since I have very little experience in how to make shaders.
